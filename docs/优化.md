## 日志导致编译 wasm blob 大小变大
```
// Note that having logs compiled to WASM may cause the size of the blob to increase
// significantly. You can use `RuntimeDebug` custom derive to hide details of the types
// in WASM. The `sp-api` crate also provides a feature `disable-logging` to disable
// all logging and thus, remove any logging from the WASM.
```
### #[derive(Debug)] -> #[derive(RuntimeDebug)]
> --execution Native 解决 #[derive(RuntimeDebug)] 导致日志显示 wasm:stripped 不显示数据
- `cargo run --release -- --dev --execution Native`
- 代码: `log!(info, "Staking: Try trigger new era: Election Result:{:?}", election_result);`
- 打印结果: `Staking: Try trigger new era: Election Result:[(, <wasm:stripped>), (, <wasm:stripped>)]`

### `sp-api` crate also provides a feature `disable-logging`
